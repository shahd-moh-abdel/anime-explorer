# Anime Explorer

## Overview

Anime Explorer is a simple web application that allows users to browse and explore popular anime titles. This project was created as a fun mini-project to pass the time and experiment with React and API integration.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Kitsu API for anime data

## Why I Made This

I created this project simply because I had some free time and wanted to practice my React skills. It's not meant to be a comprehensive or production-ready application, but rather a playground for trying out different concepts and having fun with code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Future Improvements?

Who knows? This was just a fun little project to keep me occupied. I might add more features if I find myself with more free time, or I might leave it as is. Feel free to fork and expand on it if you're interested!
